My solution for a coding exercise for Arena Flowers.

# Notes

* The assignment is simple enough that a short script is the most efficient approach.

* Since the objective of the exercise is also to evaluate use of TDD and OOD, this
script has been used as a starting point, with TDD used to guide a further refactoring.

* The solution is contained in a git repository, in order to preserve the history. Files
for Ruby versioning with `rvm` are provided.
